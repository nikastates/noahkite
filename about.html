			<h3>BIO</h3>
			<p>Noah Kite's music has traversed genres and continents in recent years. He spent his late teens playing lead guitar in various Portland OR bands, formed his own groups in his early twenties, and eventually made his way to Versailles, and then Paris. Previous endeavors like Zinnie for Short &mdash; a folk/post rock outfit &mdash; gave way to a solo project more open to classical and jazz influences. In the suburbs of Paris, his music turned toward a kind of chamber pop with teeth &mdash; a folk rock both lush and a little angry, inspired by days spent teaching English to Parisian children, a foreign culture's response to terrorism, and a withering long-distance relationship. After finishing his teaching stint, Kite opened the songs up: He toured Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy (performing in the small cafes of Antwerp and the red brick crenellations of old Italian cities like San Gimignano and Pistoia) before returning to Portland to record his upcoming self-titled release.

			<p class='quote-text'>"Kite’s folksy pop aesthetic feels almost classically composed, with intricate harmonies, complex orchestrations and layered rhythms. His voice is an absolute powerhouse, with a raspy tinge that lends his songs intense personality ... He’s one-of-a-kind."</p>
